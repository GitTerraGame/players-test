# Players test
Test repository to figure out how to determine players without compromising privacy.

The goal is to be able to:
- [ ] keep the player's history
- [ ] authenticate the player
- [ ] determine if employers can and should have control over authenticated player's access to the worlds they were part of
- [ ] determine if it is appropriate for employees to keep track of their repositories they were once members of
- [ ] determine if players can keep a list of the worlds they ever contributed to, with multiple emails on file
- [ ] determine if we can combine player's commits made under different email addresses in the same repo

## Authentication options
- [ ] email link (for working, public emails)
- [ ] token commits to the repo
- [ ] signed commits
- [ ] git provider's (e.g. Github or Gitlab) identity APIs
