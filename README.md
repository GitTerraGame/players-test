# Players test
Test repository to figure out how to determine players without compromising privacy.

The goal is to be able to:
- keep the player's history
- authenticate the player
- determine if employers can and should have control over authenticated player's access to the worlds they were part of
- determine if it is appropriate for employees to keep track of their repositories they were once members of
- determine if players can keep a list of the worlds they ever contributed to, with multiple emails on file
- determine if we can combine player's commits made under different email addresses in the same repo
